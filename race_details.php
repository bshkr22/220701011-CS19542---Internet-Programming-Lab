   Friday practice sessions are held on a Thursday.
The race weekend consists of Practice sessions held on friday, qualifying sessions on Saturday and the race on Sunday.

            <p>Each track is sectioned into 3 sectors. Each sector is approximately one-third of the track length. 
                These sectors are used to measure sector times which says how long does it take to drive each sector 
                and the 3 times are added to give the lap time.</p>
        
        <p>A <b>purple</b> sector means that time is the fastest of any driver over that section of the course. 
        When you are watching F1, you may notice a driver with a purple sector that turns green. 
        This will happen when a driver behind them has gone even faster than they did over the same sector. 
        When a driver completes a lap with three purple sectors, they have just set the fastest lap time.</p>

        <p>
        A <b>green</b> sector is a personal best for the driver. Although it is that driver’s personal best, another driver has gone faster.</p>

        <p>
        A <b>yellow</b> sector is slower than the driver’s other times for that sector. Yellow and green sectors only refer to the driver’s past laps, whereas a purple sector is across all drivers.
        </p>

        <p>There are <b>speed trap</b> at the end of each long straights to measure the speed which helps in crowning the fastest lap title to the driver 
        at the end of the race.</p>

        <p>DRS will be enabled for the driver in the straights.
        <b>DRS detection zone</b> tracks the time difference between the driver and the competitor, if it is near to one second DRS will be enabled for them.

      <p>On the surface, these sessions seem to be an hour or so of random running which wouldn't be much interesting 
        for a fan. However, from an engineer’s point of view, practice sessions can be the<b> most useful time throughout the weekend</b>, 
        as they allow teams time to set up the car according to the specifications 
        of each race track thus optimising qualifying and race performance.</p> 

       <p>Furthermore, utilising these practice sessions to test new updates and upgrades to various elements of the car can be a 
        significant contributing factor in their development throughout the season.</p>

     <p>Free practice is split into 3 session: FP1, FP2, FP3.  
        Practice session are for individual teams and their drivers to familiarise themselves with the track and fine-tune their cars.</p>

    <p>During practice sessions, the drivers will try out different types of tyres on the track to find out how long they last. 
       They will also keep a close watch on their fuel consumption with different tyres and tune their engines accordingly.</p>

    <p>Drivers use the practice sessions to get a good feel of the track and the car. They will use this knowledge to get a good position 
       in the qualifying rounds. Watching the practice sessions will let you identify the different cars and drivers during the race. 
       It also gives you a chance to watch all the behind the scenes activities.</p>

      <p>Qualifying sessions are the most exciting experience you will get on a racing weekend. Generally held on Saturday afternoons, there 
    are three qualifying phases Q1, Q2 and Q3. During qualifying sessions, drivers will push their machines to the brink in order to get 
    a good position on the grid.</p>

    <p>In Q1, or the first qualifying round all the 20 cars (if there are 20 cars participating) will take part. The five cars finishing last 
    will be eliminated from any further qualification sessions. They will take the grid positions from 16 to 20 depending on their timings in Q1.</p>

    <p>The remaining 15 cars will participate in the Q2 session. In this session a further five cars that finish last will be eliminated from 
the last qualifying session. They will take grid positions according to their performance in the Q2 session.</p>

<p>Q3 is the last qualifying session and decides the grid position for the remaining 10 cars. In this session, drivers will really work their 
throttles during this session in a bid to win the pole position. The pole position is considered a distinct advantage. The polesitter gets 
an overwhelming advantage in the race.</p>

      <p> After the grid is set in qualifying, barring any penalties either for wrongdoing or technical changes to the car, the grid will start how 
they ended qualifying.</p>

    <p>The cars come out early for an installation lap, then grid up, where they are assessed by the team, and the drivers have an anxious wait 
as the clock ticks down until the race begins. </p>

    <p>After a ‘parade lap’ of the drivers being driven around the track to wave to the crowd, they fire up the cars and complete a warm-up lap 
behind the safety car.</p>

<p>At the completion of the warm-up lap, the starter waits for the signal, then it’s lights out and away we go!</p>

<p>The race comes to an end with the chequered flag.</p>
